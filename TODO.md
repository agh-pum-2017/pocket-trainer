# TODO

* When finished and clicking "Start over", the upcoming exercise is displayed. However, when clicking back it should go to today rather than start over again.
* Show progress bar on recovery day.

* Prepare test data with muscles, genders, superset (no gaps between actions), different kinds of actions, etc.
* Install from remote location (HTTP hook already in place and tested, albeit synchronous)
* Show progress stats.
* Delete installed programs.
* Integrate running maps and location (distance vs. time).
