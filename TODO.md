# TODO

* When finished and clicking "Start over", the upcoming exercise is displayed. However, when clicking back it should go to today rather than start over again.
* Prepare test data with muscles, genders, superset (no gaps between actions), different kinds of actions, etc.
* Install from remote location (HTTP hook already in place and tested, albeit synchronous)
* Integrate running maps and location (distance vs. time).
* Summary - how long it took to finish a workout.
* number of completed actions (non-recovery) vs. all non-recovery actions on each screen?

## Nice to have

* Configurable number of seconds (e.g. announcement every 30 seconds, countdown when <= 10 seconds, etc.)
* Default music / custom music / vibrate / turn off.
* Variable (random?) music samples.
* Spotify integration
* TTS language and locale.
* Pre-generate TTS for better performance.
* Audio mixer (volume down when speaking).
* Cast to ChromeCast.
* Multiple languages.
* Responsive design (different screen orientations and sizes).
* Improve performance.
